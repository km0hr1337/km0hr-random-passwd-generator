# km0hr-random-passwd-generator
I made a random password generator using Python 3; I did this out of boredom. Currently learning python for backend development so I looked online for a beginner project idea. Don't use this for generating your passwords; it's not a strong password generator, just simply showing off a beginner project I did.
